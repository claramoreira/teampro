# TeamPRO

TeamPro is an application idea to meet the need to form teams for group sports, such as football.
The original idea is to build an app where people can find teams to play together.

For instance, as a goalie, I'm going to try to find teams that have a goalie as an open position and I'm going to join that team and we're going to be able to play together.

> **Disclaimer:** This is just an idea to be explored as a way of studying software development.

### Use-Case Diagram

Since the idea is to create a very simple application, there will be little use cases at first.
Because the idea is to create a very simple app at first, there will be few use cases at first.
The user will only be able to:
- Log onto the system
- Create a team
- Join a team
- Resign from a team
