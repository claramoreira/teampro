# TeamPro

TeamPro is an application idea to meet the need to form teams for group sports, such as football.
The original idea is to build an app where people can find teams to play together.

For instance, as a goalie, I'm going to try to find teams that have a goalie as an open position and I'm going to join that team and we're going to be able to play together.

> **Disclaimer:** This is just an idea to be explored as a way of studying software development.
